  question: `There are lots of pandemic grifters out there, taking advantage of people when they are at their most vulnerable. How do I know this isn't a scam?`,
  answer: `You are wise to do your due-diligence before donating money or sending your personal information (address) to a website! Good job!  You can verify that this is a real initiative by real people in several ways:

1) Donate A Mask Project founder and Executive Director of Evidence-Based Social Enterprises Canda, Mekki MacAulay, has a deliberately public profile on the Internet that goes back two decades.  You can find everything about him on his LinkedIn Profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mekkim), his Twitter (https://twitter.com/mekki), his Facebook (https://facebook.com/mekki), and so on.  You can also email him at mekki@donatemask.ca with any concerns or questions.  

Mekki takes his obligations as a Professional Engineer (PEng) registered with Professional Engineers Ontario (License #100134797) very seriously.  One of his obligations as a Professional Engineer is to always hold the public interest as paramount.  The word of a professional engineer is his oath.  You can look up Mekki's professional engineering registration at this site: https://www.peo.on.ca/directory (search for Mekki as first name--there's only one!).

2) The Donate A Mask Project is an initiatve of Evidence-Based Social Enterprises Canada, a registered Charitable Organization*.  You can look up the organization with the Canada Revenue Agency to verify that it is, indeed a real charitable organization, at this location: https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/dsplyBscSrch?request_locale=en

[*Chariable registration application in progress]

3) Lastly, if you are a media organization who wants to validate that we are real and do due diligence before publication, please reach out to us at marketing@donatemask.ca and we will be happy to provide any documentation you may wish to validate who we are and what we do.

4) The Donate A Mask Project Canada leverages the principles of the open source movement of transparency and auditability.  Our web page and activities are deliberately accessible to the general public via GitHub at this location: https://github.com/mekkim/donatemask - We would LOVE it if you want to reproduce this project using our resources in your own jurisdiction (USA? France? UK? Reach out to us! We'll help get you set up!)`,

  question: `When you say that you will provide "high-quality" masks to those who request them, what do you mean?`,
  answer: `There is a lot of confusing messaging about masks, masking, and mask quality circulating during the pandemic.  When we say "high-quality" masks, what we mean is "NIOSH N95- respirators of various configutations or equivalent".  Technically, we are providing "respirators", not "masks", but since most people use the term "mask" in common discussions, we've adopted that term for simplicity of communication.  

We have three tiers of reference masks that we attempt to procure and distribute as part of this initiative.  Wherever possible, based on supply chain availability, we will provide the tier 1 masks.  In the event that they are not available, we will substitute tier 2 and 3 masks as necessary.  The lowest tier masks we provide will still be "NIOSH N95-rated or equivalent".

The majority of the masks we distribute are Canadian-designed and/or Canadian-manufactured that are approved by Health Canada for use in healthcare settings with airborne pathogens, like COVID-19.  That means that most of the masks we distribute also have ASTM Level 3 (highest) splash protection, in addition to 95% (or greater) efficiency against airborne particles.  

Because the NIOSH N95 standard is American, Canadian manufacturers use a range of similar standards whose underlying testing requirements meet or exceed the N95 standard.  Most of the masks we distribute are actually rated closer to NIOSH N99 in their test results.

Another major issue in quality is fit.  We only provide masks with headband straps. We do not distribute masks with earloop straps.  That's because masks need a tight fit on the face in order to be effective, and the pulling on the ears required to achieve that tight fit is too uncomfortable for most (especially children!). As a result, earloop masks are often worn incorrectly, to diminished effectiveness.  To address this issue, we simply decided to only provide headband strap masks that are designed to be worn by healthcare workers for 12 hour shifts comfortably.  In fact, the regular size mask we distribute presently is the same model worn by EMS in Ontario, from the same Canadian designer!

Please note that while we will make every effort possible to ensure the quality of the masks and othe ritems we provide, we cannot and will not take on any responsibility or liability for their effectiveness for any or no purpose.  All products requested and received are used at your own risk.  Please see our Terms of Use for more details.`,

  question: `bUt MaSKs aRE bAd FoR yoU!!!1!one!11!!`,
  answer: `Please look at the title of our organization once more: "Evidence-Based Social Enterprises Canada".  We're not here to debate with anti-science zealots.  Don't want our free masks delivered right to your door using the labour of volunteers and the funding of genrous people who want our communities to be healthier?  Kool. Make room for those who want to protect themselves and the people they care about.  Don't let the website/app close button hit you on the way out!`,
},
   
  {
  question: `How many masks can I request?`,
  answer: `Please request what you feel you and those you are requesting for can use over a 60 day period at most..  Recent research has shown that you can safely sanitize and reuse masks up to 25 times, so please clena and reuse them as much as you can so that there are more to go around.  Details here: https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(21)00741-0/fulltext - If you need more masks later on, please feel free to submit another request.`,
},
   
  {
  question: `I'm requesting for an organization/group/other larger number. Can you help us out?`,
  answer: `So far we have been able to support the organizations (including Schools, Churches, shelters, outreach groups, etc.) who have requested masks from us.  Assuming we are able to locate contining funding for this charity program, we should be able to continue to meet the demans of organizations as well.  If your request is too large or there's some issue with it, we'll reach out to you via email to discuss.  If you don't hear from us, you can safely assume it's in the mail!`,
},
   
  {
  question: `If you get more requests for masks than donations, how do you prioritize who gets masks?`,
  answer: `Initially, we were going to use a triage to prioritize mask requests based on funding and need.  However, we were able to get a loan on generous terms in order to purchase large quantities of masks directly from manufacturers at lower prices, so we have been fulfilling mask requests that don't have matching donations at present.  We'll continue to do this so long as our loan terms hold with the hope we'll be able to get a charity grant to keep operating soon!`,
},
   
  {
  question: `Why do you list "donations" in "masks" instead of dollars?  And why do you have the cost of "one mask" set at $1.25 (CAD)?`,
  answer: `Great question!  We wanted to distinguish ourselves from other charitable initiatives by helping donors visualize exactly what they were doing.  By sizing donations in "number of masks", donors can visualize their friends, family and other members of society wearing those masks and directly understand the impact of their donation in terms of increased public health.  

The value of $2.50 "per mask" was the original value that was selected as a quasi-arbitrary number that incorporates factors such as mask cost, shipping costs, and organization costs, rounded upwards deliberately.  We, of course, pay nowhere near that amount per mask as we make volume purchases from suppliers.  More recently, in order for our stats page to reflect the reality of our funding situation more accurately, we lowered this amount to $1.25 per mask, which roughly covers the cost of masks and shipping and overhead based on the volumes we have purchased.

Where there is extra money, more masks will be shipped with those funds; simple as that.  Everyone working on the Donate A Mask Project is an unpaid voluneer (whom we greatly appreciate!).  100% of donated funds go directly to the mission of putting masks in the mailboxes of requestors.  

If you're a media organization who wishes to report on this project, please reach out to us at marketing@donatemask.ca and we will be happy to show you all of our financial statements so that you can validate how the money is used in this charity project.`,

  {
  question: `I am a large donor / donor organization who supports your missio nand wants to make a large contribution of charitable funding; how do I do that?`,
  answer: `We're exited to collaborate with other like minded organizations who understand the importance of putting high-quality masks directly in the hands of the most vulnerable in our society.  Reach out to us at donate@donatemask.ca and we can work out collaboration/donation details.  Thank you!`,
},
   
  {
  question: `Will you issue a charitable donation receipt for my donation?`,
  answer: `Yes, caveat: Our incorporation has been confirmed by Corporations Canada and our registered charity application has been fully submitted to CRA and we have a charitable organization registration number.  However, CRA takes more than 6 months to certify the charity (even though we already have our registered charity number!).  Our aim is to have all donations received after January 14, 2022 of $25 or more to be issued an official charitable donation receipt for the purposes of income tax in Canada.  However, please bear with us as we get up and running and please be understanding if our government paperwork takes longer than expected and we aren't able to issue charitable receipts until a later date (if we have problems with the paperwork, etc.).  Feel free to reach out to us at donate@donatemask.ca for status updates on the registered charity paperwork progress.`,
},
   
  {
  question: `You provide a lot of ways to donate money.  Which is best for the Donate A Mask Project?`,
  answer: `Thanks for thinking about the flow of money.  As you no doubt know, payment processing can be expensive for charities.  We wanted to make a large range of donation payment options available to make donations as easy as possible, but, indeed, some cost more than others.

The simplest and most cost-effective way for us to receive donations is via INTERAC email transfers sent to donate@donatemask.ca.  They will be auto-accepted (eventually! Our banking partner, Desjardins, doesn't yet support auto-accept of INTERAC email transfers for business accounts! Only personal accounts for some reason! They've promised it'll be available soon!) and we will reply with confirmation of receipt to the email you used to send the donation.  In this manner, we receive 100% of the funds, with no fees.  Some other means are also cost effective, so please feel free to use the means that are best for you.`,
},
   
  {
  question: `I LOVE the Donate A Mask Project! I want to volunteer to help out!`,
  answer: `Thanks! We LOVE passionate people and we welcome your help. Please reach out to us at volunteer@donatemask.ca and we'll find a way to put your specific skills and interests to work towards our mission of making high quality masks available to everyone with minimal fuss!`,
},
  
  {
  question: `Is there a mobile app available`,
  answer: `Not yet.  We're working on it and we'll let you know when it's live.  For now you can access the page using a mobile web browser.`,
},

  {
  question: `How do I check the status of my mask request?`,
  answer: `Right now, we don't have an easy way for you to do that. In order to get up and running quickly, we chose an agile, incremental approach.  Order status is on our feature to-do list!  If you really need to know the status of your order urgently, please email us at request@donatemask.ca and one of our volunteers will look it up manually for you.`,
},

  {
  question: `How long will shipping take?`,
  answer: `The shipping itself will mostly be done by Canada Post regular mail/regular parcel in order to keep costs as low as possible.  Therefore, regular Canada Post service times to your location (from Toronto) with their usual caveats are the approximate shipping time.  We usually ship out masks 3-4 times per week.`,
},

  {
  question: `We would like to sponsor your charity project in exchange for showcasing our brand or logo. Will you do that?`,
  answer: `Yes! Absolutely! We welcome corporate/other sponsorship.  We'll gladly showcase your logo/brand on the sponsor/thank you section of our site to recognize your contribution.  We may also be able to issue a charitable receipt to your organization for your donation (according to CRA accounting uidelines).  Please reach out to us at donate@donatemask.ca to coordinate your sponsorship!`,
},

  {
  question: `I noticed something broken or that could be improved on your page. How do I report it?`,
  answer: `Thanks for noticing!  Please email us at tech@donatemask.ca with your problem report and we'll add it to our list of things to fix/improve!`,
},

  {
  question: `Is this charity project politically motivated? `,
  answer: `Hard no. Under the charitable organizations regulations with the Canada Revenue Agency, we cannot be involved in political matters to maintain our charitable status. Nothing on here or in our social media should be interpreted as politically motivated. We focus on the evidence, the science, and what actually helps vulnerable people.`,
},

  {
  question: `Where does your funding come from?`,
  answer:` 100% of our funding comes from donations from people like you and organizations willing to help out. We do not receive any government grants or other such funding to run this charitable initiative. Yet!  We are applying for government and other charitable grants to support this initiative and will update you if we're lucky enough to receive them!`,

Feel free to reach out to us at volunteer@donatemask.ca to discuss further.`,
},

  {
  question: `Why do you keep statistics for your initiative?` ,
  answer: `We believe that data are incredibly important in pandemic response. One of the goals of this initiative is to identify just how much a gap there is in access to masks. That's why we track those data carefully.`,
