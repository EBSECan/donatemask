{
  question: `Is there a mobile app?`,
  answer: `Not yet.  We're working on it and we'll let you know when it's live.  For now you can access the page using a mobile web browser.`,
},

{
  question: `The site opens weird on mobile browsers?`,
  answer: `Yes. We know.  We're sorry about that.  We're working on it.  You may have to select the "request desktop page" in your mnobile browser if the page doesn't render correctly on your device as a workaround in the meantime.  We'll get it fixed soon!,
`},

{
  question: `How do I check the status of my order?`,
  answer: `Right now, we don't have an easy way for you to do that. In order to get up and running quickly, we chose an agile, incremental approach.  Order status is on our feature to-do list!  If you really need to know the status of your order urgently, please email us at request@donatemask.ca and one of our volunteers will look it up manually for you`,
},

{
  question: `How long will shipping take?`,
  answer: `The shipping itself will mostly be done by Canada Post regular mail/regular parcel in order to keep costs as low as possible.  Therefore, regular Canada Post service times to your location (from Toronto) will apply. However, requests will not be sent to shipping unless enough donations are available to purchase the masks and the masks have been purchased and are available to ship from the suppliers.  When we run out of masks/donations, we will do our best to work towards getting more masks and donations and then turn our focus back on shipping when we have the stock.  It's not an ideal process, but it's the best our team of volunteers can do for now.  Thanks for understanding.`,
},

{
  question: `We would like to sponsor your charity project in exchange for showcasing our brand or logo. Will you do that?`,
  answer: `Yes! Absolutely! We welcome corporate/other sponsorship.  We'll gladly showcase your logo/brand on the sponsor/thank you section of our site to recognize your contribution.  We may also be able to issue a charitable receipt to your organization for your donation (Details to follow as we complete our charitable status registration with the Canada Revenue Agency).  Please reach out to us at donate@donatemask.ca to coordinate your sponsorship!`,
},

{
  question: `I noticed something broken or that could be improved on your page. How do I report it?`,
  answer: `Thanks for noticing!  Please email us at tech@donatemask.ca with your problem report and we'll add it to our list of things to fix/improve!`,
},

{
  question: `Is this charity project politically motivated? `,
  answer: `Hard no. Under the charitable organizations regulations with the Canada Revenue Agency, we cannot be involved in political matters to maintain our charitable status. Nothing on here or in our social media should be interpreted as politically motivated. We focus on the evidence, the science, and what actually helps people. We like whatever political parties support evidence-based policy. We dislike any political parties who do the opposite--On an issue by an issue basis, not by party lines or colors.`,
},

{
  question: `Where does your funding come from?`,
  answer:` 100% of our funding comes from donations from people like you and organizations willing to help out. We do not receive any government grants or other such funding to run this charitable initiative.`,

  question: `I noticed that many of the volunteers on this project are from IBM. Does IBM endorse this project? `,
  answer: `No. We are all individual volunteers who do not speak for or on behalf of IBM. We just happen to work there. We also have volunteers from Google, Shopify, OpenText and many other organizations lending their skills as individuals, not on behalf of their employers.`
},

{
  question: `I want to set up a fundraising campaign to support your charity; how do I do that? `,
  answer: `Thank you very much for your interest in supporting us! Email us at donate@donatemask.ca and will help get your fundraising initiative set up with you.`,
},

{
  question: `Can you help people get access to things other than masks? Vaccines? Other protective equipment? `,
  answer: `No. There are other organizations that are focused on those things. We decided to focus specifically on masks as that's where we saw a gap in the current services for vulnerable people. We would be happy to collaborate with other organizations focusing on other areas, such as to provide kits where we contribute the masks. Reach out to us if you're one of those organizations at donate@donatemask.ca.`,
},

{
  question: `I've already submitted one order. Can I submit another one? `,
  answer: `Yes, with a caveat: With the growing pains of the organization, second orders will be lower on the priority list. We would prefer if you only placed an order once every 60 days or longer.  Everything we do is best-effort.,
`},

{
  question: `I never received my order. What happened?`,
  answer: `We're sorry that your order hasn't arrived. It may have fallen through the cracks given the chaos of our growing pains and purely volunteer driven organization. It may also have not shipped yet if we don't yet have enough donated funds to purchase the necessary masks for your order.  If you urgently need a status update, please email us at request@donatemask.ca and one of our volunteers will try to figure out what happened to your order.`
},

{
  question: `I need to fulfill my mandatory volunteer hours for school/other purpose. Can you certify my volunteer hours?`,
  answer: `Yes. We would be glad to certify volunteer hours for whatever purpose. We're also glad to have students use this project as part of course work in any discipline and at any level and we will provide mentorship/oversight.  Feel free to reach out to us at volunteer@donatemask.ca to discuss further.`,
},

{
  question: `Why do you keep statistics for your initiative?` ,
  answer: `We believe that data are incredibly important in pandemic response. One of the goals of this initiative is to identify just how much a gap there is in access to masks. That's why we track those data carefully.`,
},

{
  question: `I am an academic researcher and I would like to study your organization and its data for the purpose of academic publications. Who do I reach out to?` ,
  answer: `We are a big fan of academic research. Our project founder, Mekki, is an academic himself, and he would be delighted to collaborate with researchers looking at this project from a number of different theoretical perspectives. Reach out to him at mekki@donatemask.ca to discuss potential collaborations.`,
},

{
  question:` We would like to use some of this project's source code in our own projects but need a different license than the open source license provided. Will you consider different licensing?`,
  answer: `Maybe. Reach out to Mekki at mekki@donatemask.ca to discuss your needs.`,
